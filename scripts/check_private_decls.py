"""Check that headers declare only a unit's *public* interface.

Complements check_naming.py, which enforces the forward half of the invariant
(every public function/extern is declared in its owning header; no `.c`
re-declares another unit's symbol). This enforces the reverse half: a header
must not declare a symbol that is *private* -- defined by a unit's own `.c` and
referenced by nothing outside that unit. Such a symbol belongs in the `.c`
(marked STATIC), not in any header.

Ground truth comes from the plain `make` build objects
(build/output/src/**/*.obj -- the C units' <unit>.obj and the undecompiled
asm units' asm/<name>.obj, i.e. exactly the link inputs minus the SDK libs).
For each linker symbol `sh4objtest inspect --format=json` gives the defining
object (sections[].exports[]) and every cross-object reference
(sections[].externalRelocations[]). A symbol is private iff no object other
than its definer references it.

The plain build's call graph is necessarily incomplete mid-project: a symbol
whose only C-side caller lives in a not-yet-decompiled function looks private
there even though the shipped game calls it cross-unit. So a symbol is also
considered referenced if some OTHER unit's archived original `.src`
(build/output_matching/src/asm/decompiled/*.obj -- same source check_naming.py
trusts for original symbol names) still holds a live `.IMPORT` of it; that
`.IMPORT` is ground truth that the real game links it across units, whether or
not our decompilation has reached the call site yet.

A private symbol owned by a unit's `.c` is flagged only when its name is also
declared in some `src/*.h` -- that header declaration is the thing to remove.
Types/enums/macros/typedefs are never linker symbols, so they are inherently
ignored; data owned by an undecompiled asm unit is ignored too (no `.c` to
move it into).
