 * The switch on typeCode_0x000 has the same arms as VehPartsBind_8c02786c

 * that binder cached for this vehicle type.

 * 1. Queues the entity's draw for this frame through
 *    RenderPushCall2_8c022420. Two independent cone tests against
 *    var_busState_8c1bb9d0, either or both of which can fire: the forward one
 *    (200m, ~80 degrees around the bus's last move delta) takes the
 *    detailed path, the mirror one (50m, ~15 degrees around the rear-view
 *    camera at mirrorWorldOffsetX_0x318.._0x330) the cheap one. Each picks its
 *    own LOD from the distance.
 *
 * 2. Advances the entity's wheel spin and suspension lean, then re-probes the
 *    ground under it through probeFn_0x2c8 and re-aligns worldMatrix_0x84 via
 *    VehicleModelPlace_8c020594. Skipped entirely for an entity that is
 *    neither drawn nor near the bus, and skipped again for one already aligned
 *    and standing still. */
