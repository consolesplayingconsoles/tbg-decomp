 * not walk between them: each step happens on the one frame
 * var_passengersFadedOut_8c22895c is set, so the sprite vanishes at one spot and
 * reappears at the next.
 *
 * Named by position in the sequence rather than by what is there, because
 * what is there moves: StopSpawnInit_8c02d968 fills the six slots from the
 * same six coordinates in REVERSED order on Ome, swapping which door each
 * sequence uses. (0.15, 0.68, 0.27) is hard against the driver -- the fare
 * box -- and lands in boardSpot2 on flat-fare Shinjuku/Wangan but in
 * exitSpot2 on distance-fare Ome, which is also why 02d19c gates the
 * boarding voice lines on non-Ome and the exiting ones on Ome: the
 * greeting plays wherever the passenger passes the driver.
 *
 * Geometry, against init_seatPositions_8c04c3e4: the +x wall has no seat
 * slot between z = -0.33 and 3.95, and every waypoint falls in that gap, in
 * two z clusters (~0.3-0.9 and ~2.6-3.0) -- two doors. (1.0, 0.35, 2.8) is
 * the only point at half floor height and sits alone in the gap: the
 * doorwell step.
 *
 * Open: the two y=0 points, (-1.6, 0, 0.9) and (-1.39, 0, 2.63), are on -x,
 * the side with the unbroken seat row, though their z matches the doors.
 * They are also the only two rewritten in place by njCalcPoint against
 * var_busState_8c1bb9d0.worldMatrix_0x084, and StopSpawnInit_8c02d968 runs once at
 * course start -- so that transform, not the coordinate, is the thing to
